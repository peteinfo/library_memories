"PhD Researcher, Department of English",I spent a lot of time in the Queens library because it has a lovely view of most of the city... I would pick buildings out through the window to try and explore closer up because I hadn't really explored much of the city... I was using the library as a telescope of sorts to try to pinpoint what I would be doing outside of the library and engaging with the wider community.,1,3,1,5,2,Physical Geography,GB,62,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,44,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health
"PhD Researcher, Department of English",There were times I would key into Queens with my flat mate who was not an engineering student but they were in desperate need of a quiet place to think and decide what their long term career goals were...Ê and while they didn't necessarily engage with the content it would be this space of reflection and calm.,1,3,1,5,2,Physical Geography,GB,63,Psychology,BF,45,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health
"PhD Researcher, Department of English","Opportunity to trigger some form of curiosity is something major that makes a library a library like you know, you can get up and your curiosity could be triggered by an online source, or maybe something that the librarian is doing, or maybe a poster that you know you've seen on the wall about something in the library. Any of these things can trigger some amount of curiosity, and I think a library as a space to trigger curiosity is what makes it a library, whereas my curiosity was never triggered in my undergrad library. There was never one... there was not a single moment where I was curious to explore anything in that library except for the exit.",1,3,1,5,2,Newspapers,AN,76,Recreation & Leisure,GV,50,The Newspapers Handbook,Encyclopedia of Leisure and Outdoor Recreation
"PhD Researcher, Department of English","I would much rather spend time with Ms Sawyer in the library and I remember she and and I kind of developed a friendship. We'd get new books and I'd be the first person to read them now because she would know that 'Ohh as this is really great, you're really going to like it because you like these other couple books that we talked about last time' It really was like the first time I had like a closer relationship with the librarian and to have someone who knew me well enough to who could, like, show me things that I'd wanna read and then me being able to help her.
After school was really nice and I still really fondly remember those parts of school. Like I don't remember anything else I did in middle school. You can ask me about impactful teachers, what have you, but I only remember Ms Sawyer in the library and I think that's a testament to how important that time after school was to me.",1,3,1,5,2,Philosophy,B,84,Theory and Practice of Education,LB,66,Philosophy of Science,Theory and Practice of Online Learning
