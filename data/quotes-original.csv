A university librarian,"I was very, very early reader. Very early uptake on reading and in fact one of the first things I remember reading was the football results in my dad's Sunday paper in the days when it was a broad sheet, I used to get it on the carpet on the ground and kneel in front of it and read the football results. So, at the age of about three and a half to four I could read things like Hamilton Academicals.",2,4,2,2,4,Newspapers,AN,76,Recreation & Leisure,GV,50,The Newspapers Handbook,Encyclopedia of Leisure and Outdoor Recreation
