Any of these things can trigger some amount of curiosity, and I think a library as a space to trigger curiosity is what makes it a library, whereas my curiosity was never triggered in my undergrad library.

After school was really nice and I still really fondly remember those parts of school. Like I don't remember anything else I did in middle school.

Current English Student ,My friend would unplug the monitors of the computers next to him so no-one could sit next to him and he could have some private space. If I missed the 8am call and was a bit late I would walk in and plug in the computer next to him thereby outing his immoral behavior. ,5,3,5,4,3,Physical Geography,GB,191,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,173,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health
Curent English Student,"My friend and I took turns bringing food to the library. One time, I forgot utensils and we looked around the computer room for something to use. He grew up in Thailand so we had very different approaches to utensils. While I found a leaflet for the uni gym and fashioned it into a cardboard shovel, he had already found two pens that he was using as chopsticks and eating in an elegant fashion.",5,1,5,4,3,Physical Geography,GB,192,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,174,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health
Music Student Alumni,"There is a small library in the music building and in our first week 10-12 of us decided to meet there for the first time in real life.

Botanist and Advocate for Green Infrastructure,Libraries played a big part in my life.

Botanist and Advocate for Green Infrastructure,"Linnaeus established the Latin names and phraseologies which we use in botany. I remember reading about his legions of people who would go out to the far stretches. He tended to sit like a spider. He went to Finland in his early years and explored around Europe but when it came to the Americas and places like that, he sent out apostles to gather the information send the information back.",5,2,3,4,3,Physical Geography,GB,197,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,179,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health

Botanist and Advocate for Green Infrastructure,"There is a movement which links gardens with libraries. Libraries are a way of gathering people together. But also, if it's a fine day, why aren't people taking books out into the garden and having those other sensory experiences? It's a way of providing space and an environment to enjoy reading a book.",5,1,1,5,5,Physical Geography,GB,200,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,182,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health
Botanist and Advocate for Green Infrastructure,"One thing I'm currently working on is green infrastructure. As with libraries, they are everywhere. Libraries are not just about the books and information. As we move into a new era where information is readily available from the Internet and books are downloadable, the library becomes a place to be social. They need to adapt. It's the same with green spaces.",5,1,1,5,3,Physical Geography,GB,201,Theory and Practice of Education,BF,183,"Applied Geography: Principles and Practice: An Introduction to Useful Research in Physical, Environmental, and Human Geography",Psychology & Health

Michael Richardson, who was head in this department until recently, was looking for some medieval fragments for students to study and he recognized the word 'Merlin' and thought 'hm'.

Special Collections Staff," I know someone who was reading someone's letter books every day and she literally felt like she knew the guy. It's a really interesting job, being a project archivist.

Special Collections Staff," My favorite aspect is engaging with the readers. When preparing materials, you become an 'expert' for the day. It could be the penguin collection or the feminist archives or Brunel. Its a bit of a carousel - in the best sense.

Special Collections Staff,"What's so special about the archives is that it is for people. It's going to be relevant to someone's research or interests.

Special Collections Staff,I can just pull something out like the magazines there from the Women's movement in the 1970's. I'll be talking to groups of students who weren't around at that time and it's a really lovely connection between people and things.

Special Collections Staff, This is the last thing I did. We collect campaign election leaflets from parliamentary elections and the earliest are from the mid 19th century.
