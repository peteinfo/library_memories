NAME,QUOTE
Eszter,I spent a lot of time in the Queens library because it has a lovely view of most of the city so in that way when I was studying and also trying to decide what I would be doing later I would pick buildings out through the window to try and explore closer up because I hadn’t really explored much of the city… I was using the library as a telescope of sorts to try to pinpoint what I would be doing outside of the library and engaging with the wider community.
Eszter,There were times I would key into Queens with my flat mate who was not an engineering student but they were in desperate need of a quiet place to think and decide what their long term career goals were…  and while they didn’t necessarily engage with the content it would be this space of reflection and calm.
Eszter,Something that I really found unique to Bristol was how different each of these spaces are… I found it really interesting how the changes in the environment really affected the way I would do work… so the range of buildings that the library offers at Bristol gave me a new experience of how I was influenced by these environments.
Eszter,I get these insights into a realm of knowledge that I have no idea about but these people are so specialist in these areas… it’s almost like a roulette wheel of knowledge that I have access to.
Eszter,"I think that libraries are something that you need to build into and develop a relationship with, because I feel there is this attitude that libraries are spaces you use functionally and that you take from, that you go there for a function for a thing, you enter, you leave, and that’s like an event. I think often that we don’t think about the longer use of the library the experience that grows over [visiting] time and time again."
Josh,"Public libraries are way more accessible here; university libraries are more accessible. Back home there were few, but they were quite limited, quite difficult to get to, and often grossly underfunded."
Josh,"I have used libraries as group study locations, quite often, because it is a nice central area where we can get access to anything, there’s computers, there’s printers, the works."
Thomas,The library is just a space to work somewhere else to be in a different headspace as opposed to being a physical thing.
Thomas,"For me that [ASSL] was the perfect space, because it would have all the books I need and it was very familiar to me"
Thomas,"For me, studying at home wasn’t really as feasible as going to the library and then you switch into a different head space and there is a sense that everyone else around you is silently tapping away doing their work so you feel part of that, like this is what I’m here for."
Thomas,"…in terms of it being a space that is always open that I felt calm in and able to study in, that had all the resources I needed… I feel it had a tangible positive impact on my time at Bristol."
Lucy,"I sometimes take my children to the library that I went to regularly as a child. There are machines that you can use to borrow and return books, but, other than that, it is much as I remember it. Sitting back on a comfy chair to listen (and now read) a story; accumulating a huge pile of books in slippery plastic covers, and then making a final selection before taking them to the counter (or now the machine); and then, on the way out, buying a cake or a jar of jam from the WI market in the Mortimer Room next door. "
Lucy,"I remember booking a computer for an hour in the local library, during which time I would log on to hotmail and reply to my emails - maybe once or twice a week! "
Lucy,"I once had a fabulous backstage tour of Bristol city library, where I visited the musty smelling vaults and climbed up to the balcony/mezzanine lined with wonderful polished wooden bookshelves and antique books.  "
Lucy,I fell asleep (more than once) tucked into a study cubicle at my university library with my head literally buried in a pile of philosophy books. 
Pravin,"I’m an avid reader, I read a lot of books, from all genres not just engineering, I love going to libraries. When I first came to Bristol, one of the first things I looked for was where the library in the University was."
Pravin,"One of the quietest things I find are the libraries, and the ambience is there, everybody is studying so its quite contagious, the environment, so you feel like studying there. "
Pravin,"And I think most of the people come there because they look at libraries like this place that is almost like a shrine… because people come there to find peace… and like if you go to a temple or go to a church people just find it peaceful, they go there in religious places to connect to God whereas libraries are where you go and connect to your work or what you’re reading or knowledge."
Pravin,Whenever I go to the library I don’t really speak to many people but I still get this sense of community just by being in that environment for sometime… I do feel that libraries are the communities in itself
Pravin,A group of us used to go study in the library so we had kind of our own community within the community
Pravin,"When doing the final exams last year, I feel like the library almost became our second home where we spent less time in our rooms and we always would be at the library. We had one of the study rooms that we had to book, and we would book it over and over, we did it for a month, it almost felt like it was our second room. And sometimes we would sleep there, just before the exams because we didn’t want to go to our house and waste one hour. I think that was the best use of the library ever in my life. Because, I think it was almost 16-17 hours we spent in the library [each day] for over a month. All of us got good grades and that was the good thing about it. But after the exams were finished, and when we actually had to go back to our rooms, it really felt like we were missing something. We were really attached to the library."
Pravin,"It is one of the places that reminds me of my purpose... in a sense it is one of those places that gives you a very crystal-clear sense of what you are there for,, so you might go there to work or you just go there to get that meditative experience"
Pravin,"I think [public libraries] are the places to bring community together and draw community in... I think it is a place that gives them calm, where they can meet other people with a sense of security as well."
Pravin,"It’s the magic of the space because we look at libraries, I think it is a perception, we look at libraries from a very intellectual perspective... and we all calm down, it is the same as going to a church or going to a temple. I said I look at libraries as more of a shrine, that comes from my cultural upbringing, because in India we call libraries “Temple of Books”"
